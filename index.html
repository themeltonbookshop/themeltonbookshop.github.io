  <h1>The Melton Bookshop</h1>
  <p>Independent Booksellers in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire</p>
  <p>To all our Customers and Friends,<p>
<p>I am afraid we have some news to share that (whilst many of you may have suspected) many will find a shock.</p>
<p>We have made the decision not to carry on the lease for the premises when it runs out 25th September. We have also decided to close the business itself.</p>
<p>As you can imagine this is a hard choice for us to make but the financial pressures of running a business and the low foot-fall on Leicester St. mean that we don't feel we can carry on as it currently stands.</p>
<p>We want to thank everyone that has been a loyal customer of the shop and supported us throughout the last 3 years and indeed since 1975!</p>
<p>We plan to continue trading until the end of August and more details will be released as time progresses.</p>
  <p>As always, I hope this finds you well.</p>
  <p>Catherine x</p>
